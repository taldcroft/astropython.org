0.2.0
-----
Major updates working toward public release.

- Add "About" page and associated handler, links.
- Change required authorization for posting from "admin" to "user"
- Add 'categories' element to config.PAGE to hold settings specific
  to category list view pages.
- Increase num_limit for list view from 20 to 50
- Rewrite SearchHandler from scratch to use a simpler but presumably
  less efficent method.  Hopefully this will scale for the needs of
  astropython.org.
- Enhancements to style.css to improve look and usability.
- Improved blog_entries.html, base.html
- Changed config "root_url" from py4ast.astropython.org to www.astropython.org
